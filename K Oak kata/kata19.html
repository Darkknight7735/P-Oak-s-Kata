&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The One Ring was forged by the Dark Lord Sauron during the Second Age to gain dominion over 
 free peoples of Middle-earth. In disguise as Annatar, 
 or "Lord of Gifts", he aided the Elven smiths of Eregion and 
 their leader Celebrimbor in the making of the Rings of Power. 
 He then forged the One Ring himself in the fires of Mount Doom.[1] 
 Sauron used the heat of Mount Doom's lava to melt gold within his hand; as he chanted a description of the Ring's power (see below), 
 Sauron took a dagger and stabbed his own palm through the gold, mixing his blood with the metal and forming it into a circle. 
 The dagger itself was destroyed by the power which Sauron channeled into the One Ring.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sauron intended it to be the most powerful of all Rings, able to rule and control those who wore the others. 
Since the other Rings were themselves powerful, Sauron was obliged to place much of his own power into the One to achieve his purpose.[2]
Creating the Ring simultaneously strengthened and weakened Sauron's power. On the one hand, as long as Sauron had the Ring, 
he could control the power of all the other Rings, and thus he was significantly more powerful after its creation than before;[3] and putting such a great portion of his own power into the Ring ensured Sauron's continued existence so long as the Ring existed. On the other hand, by binding his power within the Ring, Sauron became dependent on itâ€”without it, his power was significantly diminished.
